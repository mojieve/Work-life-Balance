# Work-life-Balance
Work-life balance has been a concern of those who are interested in quality of working life and its relation to broader quality of life. In early days of industrial revolution in Europe (and today in some parts of developing world) a primary concern was with the impact of it in our health of mind. Your work-life balance has come to the fore in the contemporary debates largely because in modern societies, the excessive demands of work has become an issue which needs to be addressed. 
In this study about daily habits, the work-life Balance survey evaluates how we thrive in both professional and personal lives: it was mainly about 5 aspects of our lives:
•	Healthy body, reflecting your fitness and healthy habits;

•	Healthy mind, indicating how well you embrace positive emotions;

•	Expertise, measuring the ability to grow your expertise and achieve something unique;

•	Connection, assessing the strength of your social network and your inclination to discover the world;

•	Meaning, evaluating your compassion, generosity and how much 'you are living the life of your dream'.

The way that this questioner has been made, is to try to investigate these five aspects in order to achieve a better understanding from respondents’ work-life balance. Based on scientific studies, Our BMI is most influenced by a quality nutrition (fruits/Vegetables) and physical activity (daily steps) that we do in our daily life. On the other hand, key influencers of our stress level are our ability to concentrate on our work during flow sessions, daily meditation and the sufficiency of our income and the hours of sleep we take at night.
Those of us who achieve the most remarkable things, have also maximized our productivity (completing our daily to-do list), focus on our activities (flow sessions) and have earnt multiple personal awards and recognition. Indeed, having a core circle of family members and close friends influences the number of new places we visit (discovery). Also, it may reduce our daily stress and improve our social connections outside of this core circle. We find more time for passion when we complete well our daily to-do list (personal productivity), flow through the day and have obtained many personal awards and recognition.
